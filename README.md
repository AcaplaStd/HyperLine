# Markup Languange by Acapla Studios
## (untitled yet)

Don't you think that `title 'My Website'` looks prettier and easier to print than `<title>My Website</title>`? We do.

Introducing Markup Language by Acapla - language that makes creating webpages much easier than HTML.

In example, this HTML code:
```
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```
has the same effect like this UML code:
```
table
    tr
        td '1'
        td '2'
        td '3'
    tr
        td '2'
        td '4'
        td '6'
    tr
        td '3'
        td '6'
        td '9'
```

You see? Now you don't have to type the same tags twice (like `<table>` and `</table>`) or useless symbols like '<', '>' or '/': now you can use Untitled Markup Language by Acapla Studios!


By the way, write us if you have any ideas about the naming ;)
